Secondly, I had this idea of using a hash map however after exploring the potential of this I realized there was a huge space tradeoff as even just for the barcode example our array would be 8+ terabytes. Towards the end of class me, Tony, and Isha started discussing our plan to maybe use a hash table which essentially stores hashes while allowing collisions. For example if we have on average 3-4 collisions at each place then we just store a arraylist or something at each position. |
| Oct. 30 | 10:30pm - 11:00pm | During this time I conceptualized the process of implementing this. Essentially step one is to create an array of p length, then for each element in the passed in reader we would read it in as a string, split it by commas, then add the key to the hash table at the specified index. However, in the case that there is a collision you want to add it to an arraylist stored at that location, since the average amount of collisions will be low you can ultimately just linear search through that. To search in this dataset after its created you would hash whatever your query is and go to that index. Then you would compare to the stored values, if there one just return that, other wise search through the rest. I think this workflow would solve this problem both efficiently (O(n) to set up and O(slightly greater than 1) to search) and space efficiently as it eliminates most if not all of the empty space found in just a huge array. I believe a polynomial rolling hash would be perfect for this application. |
